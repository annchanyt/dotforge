            <div class="article">
              <p>Dotforge health is focused on the opportunity for data powered healthcare innovation.</p>
              <p>By enabling people to live healthier lifestyles and engage with their healthcare providers, digital technology has the potential to relieve a great deal of the pressure on clinicians, hospitals and the healthcare system at large. Whether software or hardware, solutions will produce a significant amount of useful data resulting in an increasingly valuable resource for improving future patient care and efficiency.</p>
              <p>Our aim is to fast track the development of startups that address specific needs in the market. Our partnerships with leading data experts, data providers and users, allow our teams to benefit from a wealth of industry insight as they build their companies right next to one of the world’s largest health care resources – the HS CIC. Dotforge Health will integrate your startup into the healthcare ecosystem ensuring the products being developed are in tune with the constraints and needs of this market.</p>
              <p>Our 13 week programme provides health-tech entrepreneurs with the support to build, position and launch a product that addresses a tangible need within the healthcare sector. We offer co-working space, funding and an extensive network of mentors to aid in the growth and development of cutting edge health-tech startups.</p>
            </div>    
           <!--  <div class="article">
              <h5>Introduction</h5>
              <p>The trend in digital health is towards data. The hardware devices, from iPhone pedometers to diagnostic and monitoring devices, all create data.</p>
              <p>Big Data capabilities will allow this data to be combined and analysed in ways not yet understood. This will become a major resource for public health bodies, corporations, and hospitals, and as such is considered to be a high growth sector for tech investors in the near future.</p>
              <p>Our accelerator is located in Leeds, next to the NHS HS CIC, one of the largest health data resources in the world. The aim is to accelerate startups that are working in digital health, with a focus on data, by partnering with leading data experts, data providers and users, located next to the NHS Spine. We hope to fast track the development of the startups, and also produce startups that address the specific needs of the market, namely the NHS, health companies, and corporates working to promote health and wellbeing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <h5>The NHS</h5>
              <p>The National Information Board has tied NHS IT more closely to NHS policy, finance and regulation in a framework for action. Digital technology plays a key role in all three elements in the 5YfV: public health, quality of care, efficiency. There is now a concerted push to achieve more integrated models of care based on interoperable and flexible digital resources, including integrated patient records and the use of data by patients and health sector professionals. Digital Health Data is at the heart of digital health startups and innovation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <h5>Why a health accelerator?</h5>
              <p>An accelerator is a structured, time limited program to support startups and provides both mentoring and investment, along with structured networking.</p>
              <p>Accelerators become a focus for activity in the ecosystem, as they attract mentors, investors, and related businesses around defined activities, and can interface with universities to facilitate knowledge transfer between academics and startups. In that respect they can act as a unifying catalyst in a region, bringing together all the key stakeholders around an intensive innovation agenda.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <h5>Dotforge Health</h5>
              <p>Primarily, the accelerator will support early stage companies that use hardware and software, along with data, to either:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Help patients by raising awareness and support self-monitoring of their condition, and prevent the need for major medical interventions;</li>
                <li>Help doctors / insurers manage information and communicate with patients;</li>
                <li>Provide early stage screening processes to reduce impact on health service.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Digital Health is creating disruption in the healthcare sector. It is creating a new layer of non-clinical devices that allow patients to monitor conditions, and offer therapeutic solutions outside of hospitals, and alongside physicians. Many of these devices act as screening tools, introducing a step prior to clinical diagnosis that does not require a clinician’s intervention. This can help prevent expensive interventions later by alerting people early on of potential problems.  It can also reduce the pressure on clinicians and hospitals, by enabling patients to manage conditions and screen prior to reference to a clinician.</p>
              <p>The programme will support the following activity:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Attract applications from around the world and select companies, with sponsors and investors, which offer solutions to identified issues and commissioning priorities;</li>
                <li>Identify appropriate health professional or academic partnerships to support the development of the product;</li> 
                <li>Work with mentors drawn from the programme’s sponsors to help shape and focus the product development;</li> 
                <li>Use lean, customer focused processes to work with patient or user groups to refine and focus the product to solve tangible issues;</li> 
                <li>Map the most appropriate route to market for the product, including kite marking, health economics analysis and trials processes (where appropriate);</li> 
                <li>Work with Key Fund to provide in depth analysis of measurable social impacts of the companies and their products (this includes health, environmental and employment measures and value of that impact);</li>
                <li>Bring in private investors, social impact investors, corporates and public sector partners such as TSB and NESTA to provide additional early stage financing.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All of which builds an ecosystem regionally, linking to a global network of stakeholders working in this sector.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <h5>Partners</h5>
           

              <p>The Accelerator will partner with:</p>

              <p><strong>MHabitat</strong>  Located in Leeds, the mHabitat is a wholly owned subsidiary of <strong>the NHS</strong> with a particularly successful record of catalysing and incubating concepts and ideas developed by clinical services to the point of spin out and adoption.</p>

              <p><strong>University of Huddersfield</strong>  One of the most celebrated universities which foster innovation and enterprise, the accelerator will partner with the School of Computing and Engineering connecting to specific research in social services and community care.</p>
              <p><strong>Health 2.0 Manchester</strong>  Part of the global network of clinicians, health professionals and technologists exploring the championing new ways to exploit digital technologies to support better patient experience and care.</p>
            
              <p>We are inviting partners to innovate in healthcare with us.</p>
