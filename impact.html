            <h5>1. The Investment</h5>
            <p>£18,000 convertible loan note, plus an extra £2,000 you may claim back when you become VAT registered.</p>
            <p class='text-right'><a href="#"class="learn-more">Learn more<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></p>
            <div class="more">
              <p> You get a total funding of £30,000 via a convertible loan note, of which £10,000 plus VAT is programme fee and £18,000 is funding to support your company. If you become VAT registered you get the £2,000 back.</p>

          <div class="article">  
            <h5>2. How much equity do I give up?</h5>
            <p>Zero. The investment is given to you on an uncapped convertible loan. This means that our investment is only converted to equity at your next priced round of investment, which can be at whatever determined by you and your future investors.</p>

            <p class='text-right'><a href="#" class="learn-more">Learn more<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></p>
            <div class="more">
              <p>A convertible loan is considered to be the most entrepreneur friendly way of early 
              stage investing because they are designed to be signed and closed fast. The
              founders can then get back to the business of building their company.</p>

            <h5>3. Who will mentor and support me?</h5>
            <p>The program is run by 500 Startups and Seedcamp alum <a href="#">Colin Tan</a>, founder of Rentlord. He will be your experienced mentor and will be available to coach you on a day to day basis.</p>

            <p>You will also be supported by <a href="#">Emily Hill</a>, <a href="#">Dave Thornett</a> of the Key Fund, and <a href="#">Rachel Barker</a> of the Royal Society of the Arts. Together, they can introduce you to entrepreneurs, other organizations, and investors that they feel would be relevant to work with you to help you forward, as advisors or potential customers.</p>

            <p>And of course, you have access to the Dotforge family for advice: other who, like you, have executed on their idea and turned it into a bussiness.</p>

          <div class="article">
            <h5>4. What will you teach?</h5>          
            <p>We have a 13 week programme developed by Colin focusing on Pitch, Product and Metrics. A key part of this process is pivoting early if necessary, through bouncing your business model in mentor sessions and the one-to-ones.</p>

            <p>Once you have refined the business model and target market (the “Pitch” to your own team and eventually an outside investor or customer), we will help you define a meaningful “Metric” that can help you learn about the 
            adoption and growth of your product. Finally, you build “Product” to prove the business model.</p>

            <p>You also get workshops on accountancy, legals, intellectual property, plus warm introductions ecosystem.</p>
            <p class='text-right'><a href="#" class="learn-more">Learn more<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></p>
            <div class="more">
              <p> This is the broad structure of our program, reflecting the workshops and mentoring 
              sessions you will experience. But the main bulk of your time would be to build your
              product, get your early customers, and prove adoption. We will always connect you 
              to mentors within our network who may be experiencing the problem you’re trying to 
              solve and give feedback, or even be one of the early adopters of your product.</p>

              <p>Month 1 - Product: sessions on business model and metrics<br />
              Month 2 - Growth: customer development, legals and accounts<br/>
              Month 3 - Finance: sources of finance, refining your pitch, presence</p>

            <h5>5. Who is behind this?</h5>

            <p>Dotforge Impact is part of the Cabinet Office’s £10M Social Investment Fund, created to seed invest in early stage tech ventures that can make a social impact. It is run by the team behind Dotforge, a tech accelerator 
            based in Sheffield, together with the Key Fund (the UK’s largest regional social investor by deals done) and the Royal Society of the Arts.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="article">
            <h5>6. What is a “tech social venture”?</h5>
            <p>We define a tech social venture as any company that seeks to use
            technology to do social good. This is either as it’s ultimate goal, or as a
            positive effect of its use. The definition is intentionally left broad, because
            it is broad: the scope is very large, on the one hand, for the startup world
            to embrace social benefit as one of its values; and on the other hand, for
            social enterprises to use technology to amplify its impact.</p>
            
            <p>At Dotforge Impact, we consider a startup’s business model as
            something inseparable from its social impact, because we believe that
            doing good while doing business is not only good for the world we live in,
            but also ultimately, is a galvanising force that is good for shareholders,
            sales and business.</p>

            <p>Please join our mission as a mentor, founder or investee, if you too
            believe in this vision.</p>

            <p>See here to read some case studies we have done of tech social
            ventures and how you could be using these strategies to improve your
            social impact.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="article">
            <h5>7. Should I apply? What kind of team or company are you looking for?</h5>
            <p>We are always happy to receive your application, and will try to give
            feedback to founders to help you forward whether or not we eventually
            invest in your idea.</p>

            <p>These are the conditions under which a team normally joins us:</p>

            <p>(a) You are a team of at least 2 persons, one person being technical
            (usually a backend coder).</p>

            <p class='text-center'><a href="#" class="learn-more">Why do we recommend this?<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></p>
              <div class="more">
                <p>It keeps your burn rate down having tech built inhouse, especially if you have
                ambitions to create a tech company. It also makes you more investable going 
                forwards, as investors generally like to see a team with complementary skills rather 
                than an individual (unless you are this guy). Bringing a cofounder onboard also signals 
                social proof of your idea, that it is something that more than one person believes in, 
                and therefore suggests the product represents a solution that customers will enjoy-- 
                and not just you. A cofounder also signals some element of "sales" or persuasion has 
                been done already, again, making it more likely that you will be able to execute on the 
                sales or early adoption cofounder?</p>
              </div>

            <p>(b) You are able to commit full time to our programme in Sheffield for 13
            weeks. We may make exceptions if you are already a running business or
            nonprofit, and you have existing customers or a product you need to
            service.</p>

            <p class="text-center"><a href="#" class="learn-more">Why do we recommend this?<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></p>
            <div class="more">
              <p>Because we have a structured curriculum that aims to give you as much product and
                business knowledge in a short time, plus connections, feedback and mentors. The 
                programme should be seen as a time to focus. For many teams this would be the first 
                investment monies you receive, and the first time you are literally working together, 
                bouncing ideas off each other in real time as you build the product in real time. Your
                time in Sheffield should also be seen as a chance for us to get to know you, your 
                product and market, and potentially introduce you to other investors, customers or mentors we know.</p>
            </div>

            <p>(c) The product must have a socially beneficial angle. This does not
            have to be the core of the startup, but it does need to be one of the
            intended aims and uses of the product. This is a requirement because
            we are part of the Social Incubator Fund. If you are an existing startup
            or team, and would like some advice or product feedback from us how
            you could make your company more social, please feel free to get in
            touch.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="article">
            <h5>8. I don't have a protoype yet. Should I apply?</h5>
            <p>We accept companies at idea stage. However there should be proof that
            you would be able to execute on your idea and build a company. For
            example, previous projects you have created or coded (if you are a tech
            co-founder), or prior industry knowledge.</p>
            <p class="text-right"><a href="#" class="learn-more">Learn more<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></p>
            <div class="more">
              <p>The price of hiring a developer is one of your problems. In our experience, a developer
              can cost between £200 - £600 per day to hire. That’s nearly impossible to work with 
              as a burn weekly rate.</p>

              <p>In early stage investing, where there are sometimes no immediate proof of product, 
              traction, or consistent revenue, team is the only criterion for an investor to go on. This 
              means not only the quality and complementary skills of the individual members of 
              your team, but also how you know the project</p>

          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <h5>9. I don't have a tech co-founder. Should I apply?</h5>
            <p>If your potential social impact is great, and you have a knowledgable
            team to execute this idea albeit minus a tech co-founder, we will still
            consider your application. In any case, even if we do invest, we highly
            recommend that you find a tech co-founder before the programme
            begins, as it would be expensive and impractical to hire a contractor to
            work with you to build and iterate upon your product once the
            programme starts.</p>
            <p class="text-right"><a href="#" class="learn-more">Learn more<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></p>
            <div class="more">
              <p>The price of hiring a developer is one of your problems. In our experience, a developer
              can cost between £200 - £600 per day to hire. That’s nearly impossible to work with 
              as a burn weekly rate.</p>

              <p>Contractors also have to fit in your work within their calendar, around work given to 
              them by other clients, which are just as urgent as yours. This makes it hard for you to 
              respond quickly to customer feedback, and acquire more customers.</p>

              <p>A third reason is that a contractor is unlikely to sit with you through the workshops 
              and one-to-one sessions within the programme. This means they won’t be able to 
              bounce ideas around with you, and be coached by the technical teachings that you 
              learn during the programme.</p>

              <p>One last reason why you should find a technical co-founder is this: a co-founder of 
              any sorts provides social proof that your idea is a good one. It also provides to 
              investors proof of your persuasion skills, and ultimately sales skills. It is also a sign of 
              your resourcefulness.</p>

              <p>In early stage investing, where there are sometimes no immediate proof of product, 
              traction, or consistent revenue, team is the only criterion for an investor to go on. This 
              means not only the quality and complementary skills of the individual members of 
              your team, but also how you know the project</p>
