                <h5>Tech Social Ventures</h5>
                <p>Broadly speaking, a tech social venture is any company that seeks to use technology to achieve a positive social impact. As for how this is done, the possibilities are endless. Whether you’re a tech startup embracing social values, or a social enterprise using technology to amplify your impact, we are interested in supporting young companies to harness the power of digital technology to create change.</p>
                <p>Typically, we look for early stage start-ups that can commit to being in Manchester full time for the duration of the programme. We tend to recommend a team of 2 or more people (usually at least one person with a technical background). Accelerators are intense and in order to get the most out of the programme, it helps to have a team to share the workload.</p>
                <p>If you don’t currently meet the profile of teams we typically look for, but still think Dotforge Impact would be a good fit for your venture—don’t hesitate to apply. We are happy to review your application and provide insight as to whether we may be able to invest in your idea in the future.</p>

              <p>We have a 13 week programme developed by Colin focusing on Pitch, Product and Metrics. A key part of this process is pivoting early if necessary, through bouncing your business model in mentor sessions and the one-to-ones.</p>

              <p>Once you have refined the business model and target market (the “Pitch” to your own team and eventually an outside investor or customer), we will help you define a meaningful “Metric” that can help you learn about the 
              adoption and growth of your product. Finally, you build “Product” to prove the business model.</p>

              <p>You also get workshops on accountancy, legals, intellectual property, plus warm introductions ecosystem.</p>

                <p> This is the broad structure of our program, reflecting the workshops and mentoring 
                sessions you will experience. But the main bulk of your time would be to build your
                product, get your early customers, and prove adoption. We will always connect you 
                to mentors within our network who may be experiencing the problem you’re trying to 
                solve and give feedback, or even be one of the early adopters of your product.</p>

              <p>Dotforge Impact is part of the Cabinet Office’s £10M Social Investment Fund, created to seed invest in early stage tech ventures that can make a social impact. It is run by the team behind Dotforge, a tech accelerator 
              based in Sheffield, together with the Key Fund (the UK’s largest regional social investor by deals done) and the Royal Society of the Arts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
              <h5>6. What is a “tech social venture”?</h5>
              <p>We define a tech social venture as any company that seeks to use
              technology to do social good. This is either as it’s ultimate goal, or as a
              positive effect of its use. The definition is intentionally left broad, because
              it is broad: the scope is very large, on the one hand, for the startup world
              to embrace social benefit as one of its values; and on the other hand, for
              social enterprises to use technology to amplify its impact.</p>
              
              <p>At Dotforge Impact, we consider a startup’s business model as
              something inseparable from its social impact, because we believe that
              doing good while doing business is not only good for the world we live in,
              but also ultimately, is a galvanising force that is good for shareholders,
              sales and business.</p>

              <p>Please join our mission as a mentor, founder or investee, if you too
              believe in this vision.</p>

              <p>See here to read some case studies we have done of tech social
              ventures and how you could be using these strategies to improve your
              social impact.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
              <h5>7. Should I apply? What kind of team or company are you looking for?</h5>
              <p>We are always happy to receive your application, and will try to give
              feedback to founders to help you forward whether or not we eventually
              invest in your idea.</p>

              <p>These are the conditions under which a team normally joins us:</p>

              <p>(a) You are a team of at least 2 persons, one person being technical
              (usually a backend coder).</p>

              <p class='text-right'><a href="#" class="learn-more">Why do we recommend this?<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-down" aria-hidden="true"></span></a></p>
                <div class="more">
                  <p>It keeps your burn rate down having tech built inhouse, especially if you have
                  ambitions to create a tech company. It also makes you more investable going 
                  forwards, as investors generally like to see a team with complementary skills rather 
                  than an individual (unless you are this guy). Bringing a cofounder onboard also signals 
                  social proof of your idea, that it is something that more than one person believes in, 
                  and therefore suggests the product represents a solution that customers will enjoy-- 
                  and not just you. A cofounder also signals some element of "sales" or persuasion has 
                  been done already, again, making it more likely that you will be able to execute on the 
                  sales or early adoption cofounder?</p>
                </div>

              <p>(b) You are able to commit full time to our programme in Sheffield for 13
              weeks. We may make exceptions if you are already a running business or
              nonprofit, and you have existing customers or a product you need to
              service.</p>

                <p>Because we have a structured curriculum that aims to give you as much product and
                  business knowledge in a short time, plus connections, feedback and mentors. The 
                  programme should be seen as a time to focus. For many teams this would be the first 
                  investment monies you receive, and the first time you are literally working together, 
                  bouncing ideas off each other in real time as you build the product in real time. Your
                  time in Sheffield should also be seen as a chance for us to get to know you, your 
                  product and market, and potentially introduce you to other investors, customers or mentors we know.</p>
              </div>

              <p>(c) The product must have a socially beneficial angle. This does not
              have to be the core of the startup, but it does need to be one of the
              intended aims and uses of the product. This is a requirement because
              we are part of the Social Incubator Fund. If you are an existing startup
              or team, and would like some advice or product feedback from us how
              you could make your company more social, please feel free to get in
              touch.</p>

              <h5>8. I don't have a protoype yet. Should I apply?</h5>
              <p>We accept companies at idea stage. However there should be proof that
              you would be able to execute on your idea and build a company. For
              example, previous projects you have created or coded (if you are a tech
              co-founder), or prior industry knowledge.</p>

                <p>The price of hiring a developer is one of your problems. In our experience, a developer
                can cost between £200 - £600 per day to hire. That’s nearly impossible to work with 
                as a burn weekly rate.</p>

                <p>In early stage investing, where there are sometimes no immediate proof of product, 
                traction, or consistent revenue, team is the only criterion for an investor to go on. This 
                means not only the quality and complementary skills of the individual members of 
                your team, but also how you know the project</p>

              <h5>9. I don't have a tech co-founder. Should I apply?</h5>
              <p>If your potential social impact is great, and you have a knowledgable
              team to execute this idea albeit minus a tech co-founder, we will still
              consider your application. In any case, even if we do invest, we highly
              recommend that you find a tech co-founder before the programme
              begins, as it would be expensive and impractical to hire a contractor to
              work with you to build and iterate upon your product once the
              programme starts.</p>

                <p>The price of hiring a developer is one of your problems. In our experience, a developer
                can cost between £200 - £600 per day to hire. That’s nearly impossible to work with 
                as a burn weekly rate.</p>

                <p>Contractors also have to fit in your work within their calendar, around work given to 
                them by other clients, which are just as urgent as yours. This makes it hard for you to 
                respond quickly to customer feedback, and acquire more customers.</p>

                <p>A third reason is that a contractor is unlikely to sit with you through the workshops 
                and one-to-one sessions within the programme. This means they won’t be able to 
                bounce ideas around with you, and be coached by the technical teachings that you 
                learn during the programme.</p>

                <p>One last reason why you should find a technical co-founder is this: a co-founder of 
                any sorts provides social proof that your idea is a good one. It also provides to 
                investors proof of your persuasion skills, and ultimately sales skills. It is also a sign of 
                your resourcefulness.</p>
